# Unity Skill Tree Visualization - Continuation Prompt

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX IMMEDIATELY

### 1. **Separate Progression Chains** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
The skill tree is currently showing isolated progression chains instead of one coherent tree structure. We need to create a proper hierarchical flowchart that shows:

```
Discipline (Root)
    └── Curriculum
            ├── Group 1
            │   ├── Exercise 1.1
            │   ├── Exercise 1.2 (progression from 1.1)
            │   └── Module 1
            │       ├── Module Exercise 1.1
            │       └── Module Exercise 1.2
            ├── Group 2
            │   ├── Exercise 2.1
            │   └── Exercise 2.2
            └── Group 3
                └── Exercise progressions...
```

Currently it's displaying disconnected chains. We need parent nodes for Discipline, Curriculum, and Groups that connect everything into ONE tree.

### 2. **Hover Effect Breaking Nodes**
The hover effect is shrinking nodes to nothing. The issue is in `SkillTreeAnimations.cs` - the `NodeHoverEffect` class captures `originalScale` during Start() when nodes might still be animating from scale 0. I've attempted a fix but it needs verification.

### 3. **Visual Clutter in Game View**
There's a massive corner artifact with random objects when running. This needs to be identified and removed from the scene.

## PROJECT CONTEXT

### What We're Building
A Unity-based skill tree visualization for a fitness curriculum app that:
- Connects to Firebase Firestore for real-time exercise data
- Shows exercise progressions as a visual skill tree
- Allows users to track progress through exercises
- Displays prerequisites and unlock chains

### Current Implementation Status

#### ✅ Working
- Firebase Firestore integration loading data
- Basic node creation with exercise names
- Click to view exercise details modal
- Completion state tracking
- Camera pan/zoom with new Input System
- Some visual states (locked/available/completed)

#### ⚠️ Partially Working
- Nodes display but as separate chains, not one tree
- Drag to pan works but feels clunky
- Completion changes color but animations may not trigger
- Text displays but sometimes shows IDs

#### ❌ Broken
- No hierarchical structure (missing parent nodes)
- Hover effect shrinks nodes to nothing
- Visual artifacts in corner of screen
- No breadcrumb navigation
- Layout doesn't look like a proper skill tree

## FILE STRUCTURE

### Key Scripts (Assets folder)
- `ExerciseSkillTreeManager.cs` - Main tree builder and logic
- `SimpleCurriculumParser.cs` - Loads data from Firestore/sample
- `FirestoreDataService.cs` - Firebase connection (Scripts folder)
- `SkillTreeCameraController.cs` - Camera navigation (Input System)
- `ExerciseDetailModal.cs` - Exercise detail popup
- `SkillTreeAnimations.cs` - Animation effects (HOVER BUG HERE)
- `CurriculumDataModels.cs` - Data structures

### Scene Setup Required
```
Canvas
├── SkillTreeContainer (RectTransform, SkillTreeCameraController)
│   └── [Nodes created at runtime]
└── EventSystem (with InputSystemUIInputModule)

GameManager (or any GameObject)
├── ExerciseSkillTreeManager
├── SimpleCurriculumParser
└── SkillTreeAnimations
```

## DATA STRUCTURE

```csharp
Discipline
  └── Curriculums[]
      └── Groups[]
          ├── Exercises[]
          └── Modules[]
              └── Exercises[]

ExerciseProgressions
  └── Chains[]
      └── exercise_ids[] (ordered progression)
```

## IMMEDIATE TASKS

### Task 1: Create Hierarchical Tree Structure
1. Add parent nodes for Discipline, Curriculum, Groups
2. Connect all nodes into ONE coherent tree
3. Use different node sizes/styles for hierarchy levels
4. Ensure proper flow from root to leaves

### Task 2: Fix Hover Effect
1. Verify the fix in `NodeHoverEffect` class works
2. Ensure nodes grow on hover, not shrink
3. Test with different initial scales

### Task 3: Clean Up Visual Artifacts
1. Identify what's creating the corner elements
2. Remove or properly position them
3. Ensure clean game view

### Task 4: Improve Layout Algorithm
1. Implement proper tree layout (not just columns)
2. Add curved connection lines
3. Space nodes properly to avoid overlaps
4. Center the tree in view

## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Input System
Project uses new Unity Input System. All input handling must use:
- `Mouse.current` not `Input.GetMouseButton`
- `Keyboard.current` not `Input.GetKey`
- Enhanced touch for mobile

### Firebase Configuration
- Project: `hitpoints-2932c`
- Uses Firestore for data
- Can disable with `useFirestore = false` on SimpleCurriculumParser for testing

### Current Issues in Console
- May see "No exercise data found for ID" - tries to load from parser
- Check for null EventSystem warnings
- Database URL warnings can be ignored if using sample data

## DESIRED OUTCOME

A proper skill tree that:
1. Shows ONE connected tree from Discipline root to individual exercises
2. Has clear visual hierarchy (larger nodes for categories)
3. Smooth hover effects that enlarge nodes
4. Clean game view without artifacts
5. Professional appearance suitable for a fitness app

## TESTING APPROACH

1. Disable Firestore first (`useFirestore = false`)
2. Test with sample data
3. Fix visual issues
4. Then re-enable Firestore

## COLOR SCHEME TO USE
- Root/Discipline: Large, prominent (purple/gold)
- Curriculum: Large, secondary (blue)
- Groups: Medium (green)
- Exercises: Small (based on state)
  - Locked: Gray
  - Available: Blue
  - Completed: Green

## CRITICAL: User's Feedback
"They're all still separate" - This is the main issue. The progressions are showing as disconnected chains. We need ONE unified tree structure that branches out properly.

"Hover shrinks them to nothing" - Critical bug in hover animation.

"Massive corner with random objects" - Visual cleanup needed.

Focus on making it look like an actual skill tree you'd see in a video game, not separate progression lists.
