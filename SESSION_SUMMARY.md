# Session Summary - Skill Tree Enhancement Work

## What Was Accomplished

### Initial Problems Identified
1. Nodes showing UUIDs instead of exercise names
2. All progressions showing as separate chains, not one tree
3. Modal blocking further interactions after first use
4. Camera drag not working
5. Dark backgrounds with poor visibility
6. Hover effect shrinking nodes to nothing

### Fixes Applied

#### ✅ Successfully Fixed
1. **Exercise Names** - Now displays proper names instead of IDs
2. **Modal Blocking** - Fixed overlay management so modal can be reopened
3. **Camera Drag** - Simplified logic, now works from anywhere
4. **Visual Colors** - Lighter backgrounds, better contrast
5. **Completion Feedback** - Added logging and color changes
6. **Input System** - Updated to use new Input System instead of legacy

#### ⚠️ Partially Fixed
1. **Hover Effect** - Added initialization delay and checks for zero scale
2. **Group Names** - Removes UUIDs and formats nicely

#### ❌ Still Needs Work
1. **Tree Structure** - Still shows separate chains, needs parent nodes
2. **Visual Polish** - Basic appearance, needs professional look
3. **Corner Artifacts** - Unknown visual elements in game view

### Code Changes Made

#### New Files Created
- `SkillTreeCameraController.cs` - Complete camera system with Input System
- `ExerciseDetailModal.cs` - Modal popup for exercise details
- `SkillTreeAnimations.cs` - Animation system with hover effects

#### Files Modified
- `ExerciseSkillTreeManager.cs` - Many improvements to visual state, layout
- `SimpleCurriculumParser.cs` - Connected to Firestore
- `CurriculumDataModels.cs` - Proper data structures

### Technical Improvements
- Migrated from legacy Input to new Input System
- Added EventSystem auto-creation
- Improved error handling and debug logging
- Better color state management
- Fixed text visibility issues

## Remaining Critical Issues

### 1. Tree Structure Problem
The biggest issue is that exercises show as disconnected progression chains rather than one unified tree. Need to:
- Add root node for Discipline
- Add branch nodes for Curriculums and Groups
- Connect everything hierarchically

### 2. Hover Animation Bug
Nodes shrink to nothing on hover because originalScale is captured during animation. Attempted fix needs testing.

### 3. Visual Artifacts
Unknown elements appearing in corner of game view need investigation.

## Handoff Preparation

### Documents Created
1. **NEW_CLAUDE_INSTANCE_PROMPT.md** - Detailed instructions for next Claude
2. **CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md** - Current state documentation
3. **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - This summary

### Documents Removed
- All old documentation files from previous sessions
- Kept only essential project files

## Recommendations for Next Session

### Priority Order
1. **Fix tree structure** - Add parent nodes, create proper hierarchy
2. **Verify hover fix** - Test and refine hover animations
3. **Clean visual artifacts** - Identify and remove corner elements
4. **Polish appearance** - Make it look professional

### Approach
1. Start with sample data (disable Firestore)
2. Fix visual/structural issues
3. Test with real data
4. Add polish and animations

### Key Insight
The main complaint is "they're all still separate" - this is because we're creating nodes only for exercises, not for the parent categories. The tree needs hierarchical parent nodes that branch out to children.

## Testing Instructions
1. Open project in Unity
2. Open HitpointsSkillTree_001 scene
3. Check SkillTreeContainer has scripts attached
4. Disable "Use Firestore" on SimpleCurriculumParser for testing
5. Press Play
6. Should see exercise nodes (currently as separate chains)

## Success Criteria
When complete, should have:
- ONE connected tree from root to leaves
- Smooth hover that enlarges nodes
- Clean game view
- Professional appearance
- Clear visual hierarchy
